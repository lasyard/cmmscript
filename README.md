C-- Script
==========

C-- Script is a simple script language.

Comments
--------

Comments are C-style, that is, in /* */ pairs.

Consts
------

There are three types of const number in C-- Script. They are all 
integers. No other data types are supported. They are

* Decimal int, like 1234, 5678, 90
* Hexadecimal int, like 0x1A, 0X2B
* Binary int, like 0b11, 0B1010

There is also const string in C-- Script. To make a string, put text 
between a pair of double quotation marks, like
"Hello, World!"
Escape characters as in a C-style string are not supported.

Varibles
--------

Rules for varible names are like in C language, except that @ and \ 
can be used in varible names.

Varibles are defined when they appear for the first time. The type of 
a varible is determined by the value assigned to it. If a varible is 
never assigned a value, its type is UNDEF. According to the values 
assigned are integers or strings, varibles can be INT or STR type, 
which are simple types.

A varible can also be VEC type, that means there are a series of 
values associated with the varible, which are indexed by integers. 
Each of the value can also be of any type. For example

	a = @
	/* @ is a built-in special varible. 
	 * To make a varible VEC type, you should assign @ to it.
	 */
	a[0] = 1; a[1] = "Hello"; a[2] = @
	a[2][0] = 2; a[2, 1] = 3 /* both are supported */

A varible can also be MAP type, that means there are a series of 
values associated with the varible, which are indexed by strings. 
Each of the value can also be any type. For example

	a = \
	/* \ is a built-in special varible.
	 * To make a varible MAP type, you should assign \ to it.
	 */
	a["first"] = 1; a.second = 2 /* both are supported */

Expressions and statements
--------------------------

Expressions are all like in C language if the operators are supported. 
The unsupported operators are:

* Post self increment ++ and post self decrement --
* Address & and derefrence *
* Ternary operator ? :

Any expressions can be statements. Statements are ended if a line is 
ended. You can use ; to seperate several statements in a single line.
But ; is not required for a statement.

Branch structure
----------------

Using ? : $ to make a branch structure, like

	a < 10 ? ++num1 : ++num2 $

That means, if a is less than 10, the value of num1 is increased by 
one, otherwise the value of num2 is increased by one.

Loop structure
--------------

Using { # } to make a loop structure, like

	i = 0 { i < 10 ?:#$ ++i }

That means, i is increased by one, starting from 0; if i is not less 
than 10, the loop ends. The codes between { and } are executed 
repeatedly, and # always makes it jump out the loop to the code after 
}.

Functions
---------

There are only built-in functions, no user-defined functions are 
supported. Functions take unlimited number of parameters and return a 
value, like

	_pw(3, a, a+b, (a+b)*c)

Currently the built-in functions are:

* _p(): to output the parameters
* _pln(): to output a line break
* _pw(): to output the parameters except the first one. the first 
  parameter is used to set the output width

Command Line
------------

In the command line interface, you can type in any codes, which are 
executed when you press Enter. There are also a few commands you can 
use, but they are not part of C-- Script. They are

* clear: to clear all user-defined varibles
* ids: to show all the varibles
* funs: to show all the functions
* run filename: to look for a file named filename.cmm, read it in and 
  execute
* exit: exit the program

Compile It
----------

On Linux, just type

	make

You will get executable file cmm

On Windows, if you are using Visual Studio Command Prompt, just type

	cl /W3 /O2 /EHsc *.cpp

You will get executable file cmm.exe
